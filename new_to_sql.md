# New to SQL?

**What is SQL? SQLPad?**

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a way to interact with data that is stored in a special kind of storage called a relational database.  This kind of data is stored in tables which have rows and columns.

SQLPad is a software package that allows you to send SQL queries to a connected relational database.  Arcus offers the SQLPad tool for you to interact with data in your lab that is stored in your Arcus relational database.

## Arcus-Specific SQL Training

Arcus On-Ramp 
-----

If you're already an Arcus user (you've signed our Terms of Use and completed CITI training), you can sign up for our Arcus On-Ramp webinars.  In these webinars, you work in a real Arcus lab analyzing CHOP's electronic health record (EHR) to replicate an actual published study. Workshops focus either on exploring the data and defining a query for your study using SQL, or running the analysis in R/Python. No coding experience is required to attend. Registration closes one week before each workshop so we have time to add registered attendees as users in the webinar training lab.  To sign up, please visit [https://arcus.chop.edu/education/webinar-signup/](https://arcus.chop.edu/education/webinar-signup/).  This link is only available for Arcus customers on the CHOP network.

Lab Training Videos

For an example of how to use SQL data in your Arcus lab, start with the training videos on your lab's landing page.

These are very introductory, but help you understand specifically how to work with your Arcus lab.  

We strongly encourage you to watch **all of the videos**, in order, even the ones that don't refer to SQL or SQLPad (a tool we use in Arcus labs to interact with SQL) specifically.  It's only about an hour of your time, and we think it will answer many of your questions and save time in the long run.

## Additional Resources

Arcus training is a great place to get started with your SQL education, but you will probably want to continue your education on your own, growing in skills that are specific to your own research goals or career needs.

You have several options when it comes to growing in your SQL skills.

There are a number of university classes, online courses and live workshops that go in depth about how to use SQL.  Simply search for courses at the university or MOOC (e.g. Coursera) you prefer to use.

If you prefer something a bit more "just in time", however, we suggest the SQL modules from the [DART (Data and Analytics for Research Training) program](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/).

DART includes dozens of data science modules that are each 1 hour or less in duration and with a narrow focus and clear learning objectives.  They are asynchronous and you can take them at any time!

<div class = "cool-fact">

Arcus Education's DART modules are the result of a study funded by [an NIH grant aimed at educating biomedical researchers](https://www.research.chop.edu/announcements/dbhi-and-drexel-collaborate-to-advance-biomedical-data-science-education).
The active research phase of this program is complete, so we are no longer recruiting learners to be our subjects.  However, if you'd like to receive updates about publications or applications of this research, please email us at dart@chop.edu.

Training Modules
------

To begin learning SQL, there are a couple of options with regard to the DART self-guided tutorial modules.

If you want a comprehensive curriculum of nearly twenty modules, you might enjoy our [Pathway 3: Big data, big questions](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/example_pathways#:~:text=Pathway%203%3A%20Big%20data%2C%20big%20questions) curriculum, which includes overview materials about reproducible research and data organization, introductory material in SQL, and some advanced topics you might need as a biomedical researcher, such as Regular Expressions.  While you're there, check out the other suggested pathways, too!
