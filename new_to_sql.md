# New to SQL?

**What is SQL? SQLPad?**

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a way to interact with data that is stored in a special kind of storage called a relational database.  This kind of data is stored in tables which have rows and columns.

SQLPad is a software package that allows you to send SQL queries to a connected relational database.  Arcus offers the SQLPad tool for you to interact with data in your lab that is stored in your Arcus relational database.

## Arcus-Specific SQL Training

For an example of how to use SQL data in your Arcus lab, start with the training videos on your lab's landing page.

These are very introductory, but help you understand specifically how to work with your Arcus lab.  

We strongly encourage you to watch **all of the videos**, in order, even the ones that don't refer to SQL or SQLPad (a tool we use in Arcus labs to interact with SQL) specifically.  It's only about an hour of your time, and we think it will answer many of your questions and save time in the long run.

## Additional Resources

The training videos barely scratch the surface of how to get started.  We did that on purpose, so that they're short enough that everyone can watch them.

But they aren't enough to get you started **really** learning SQL.  You have several options when it comes to growing in your SQL skills.

There are a number of university classes, online courses and live workshops that go in depth about how to use SQL.  Simply search for courses at the university or MOOC (e.g. Coursera) you prefer to use.

If you prefer something a bit more "just in time", however, we suggest some resources that the Arcus Education team has crafted as part of [an NIH grant aimed at educating biomedical researchers](https://www.research.chop.edu/announcements/dbhi-and-drexel-collaborate-to-advance-biomedical-data-science-education).

This grant includes the creation of dozens of modules that are aimed at being 1 hour or less in duration and each have a narrow focus and clear learning objectives.  They are asynchronous and you can take them at any time!

If you think you'd like to participate in a research study about the educational effectiveness of data science training modules, please reach out to Arcus Education's DART program via:

* Our interest form at https://redcap.link/dart-interest
* Taking the screening for participation in the study at https://redcap.link/DART-survey
* Emailing us at dart@chop.edu

If you meet our research criteria and decide to enroll as a study participant, you'll receive additional data science learning support, including a customized curriculum of materials and the peership and support of a community of learners like you.
