# New to R?

**What is R?  RStudio?**

![](media/rstudio.png)<!-- style = "max-width:400px; float:left; margin-right: 2em;"-->

R is a free, open source language that is specifically focused on statistical data analysis.  It is increasing in market share among researchers ([second only to SPSS and outpacing SAS, Stata, JMP, Matlab, and other solutions you may have used](https://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)) and has multiple advantages over "point and click" statistical data analysis.

RStudio is a free tool made by Posit (formerly RStudio) that makes using R much simpler than using R alone.  RStudio is provided as a tool in Arcus labs and is nearly identical to the RStudio you might be accustomed to using in CHOP's HPC, on CHOP's RStudio Connect server, or on your computer.  It allows you analyze data stored in your lab for your research project.

## CHOP Has an R User Group!

CHOP has a vibrant R User Group made up of employees from all over the institution who use R for many different use cases.  This is a great place to start connecting with other people, asking for help, and seeking advice.

To join, please visit [https://bit.ly/chopRusers](https://bit.ly/chopRusers)!  This will add you to the Outlook distribution list for emails as well as give you instructions on how to add yourself to our Slack workspace, where people ask coding questions (and answer them!).

Joining the R User Group means you'll be informed about periodic intro to R workshops, R User Group talks, and other resources you'll find useful.

## Arcus-Specific R Training

![](media/training_videos.png)<!--
style = "max-width:400px; float:right; margin-left: 2em;"-->

For an example of how to use R in your Arcus lab, start with the training videos on your lab's landing page.

These are very introductory, but help you understand specifically how to work with your Arcus lab.  

We strongly encourage you to watch **all of the videos**, in order, even the ones that don't refer to R specifically.  It's only about an hour of your time, and we think it will answer many of your questions and save time in the long run.

## Additional Resources

The training videos barely scratch the surface of how to get started.  We did that on purpose, so that they're short enough that everyone can watch them.

But they aren't enough to get you started **really** learning R.  You have several options when it comes to growing in your R skills.

There are a number of university classes, online courses and live workshops that go in depth about how to use R.  Simply search for courses at the university or MOOC (e.g. Coursera) you prefer to use.

If you prefer something a bit more "just in time", however, we suggest some resources that the Arcus Education team has crafted as part of [an NIH grant aimed at educating biomedical researchers](https://www.research.chop.edu/announcements/dbhi-and-drexel-collaborate-to-advance-biomedical-data-science-education).

This grant includes the creation of dozens of modules that are aimed at being 1 hour or less in duration and each have a narrow focus and clear learning objectives.  They are asynchronous and you can take them at any time!

<div class = "warning">
If you think you'd like to participate in a research study about the educational effectiveness of data science training modules, please reach out to Arcus Education's DART program at dart@chop.edu, and consider **not** consuming these modules.

Consuming these modules will **render you ineligible to participate** in our research.  However, we know that they're useful on their own, outside of our conduct of research, so we're fast-tracking access to these materials.
