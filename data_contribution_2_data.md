## data/

- Research data: Information collected during the course of research processes used for analysis
- Maintains descriptions of authoritative source data and their associated files and metadata in both raw and processed formats

### data/raw

- Arcus-delivered data goes here.
- Study team generated data brought into Arcus goes here.
- Authoritative source data that should never be deleted.
- Organize in subdirectories if necessary.

#### data/raw omics example

- Most sequencing providers will generate a [**fastq**](https://maq.sourceforge.net/fastq.shtml) file or [**cram**](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/CRAMv3.pdf) file. These files contain genomic sequences called reads. With paired reads, there are two fastq files per sample. Cram files are single files aligned to a reference genome.
- We collect the compressed fastq form fastq.gz, which can be made with lossless compression utility tools like gzip. fastq metadata are described in the fastq directory.
- Cram files are human readable and highly space efficient by using reference-based compression of sequence data. These files enable us to run a complete re-analysis of the data. Cram files require a companion index file, crai.

#### data/raw clinical example

### data/interim

- Managed by study team.
- Unregulated space for intermediate and temporary files.
- Not necessary to save long-term.
- Recommend establishing retention schedules for regular review/clean-up.

### data/interim/ omics example

- QC metrics Quality Control (QC) metrics are reported at various stages of analysis pipelines and give information about the quality of the data generated. QC metrics files should be in a tabular file format, with .type_metrics or .duplicate_metrics as the extension. QC metrics files will always be stored in the sources/data/interim directory.

### data/endpoints

- Managed by study team.
- Final results from research analysis.
- Files generated to support papers or grants.
- Organize in subdirectories if necessary.

#### data/endpoints omics example

- gvcf files contain variant information, describing genomic regions with no variants for a single sample. They are used to compare variant calls across samples to make vcf files. We collect them to enable the easy construction of larger cohorts.
- We collect the compressed version of a gvcf file, which can be made with a lossless compression utility tool like gzip.
- vcf files usually contain multiple samples, and are the starting point for most reserach project's analysis. They are not appropriate for constructing cohorts from multiple projects because they are missing necessary information contained in the gvcf files. We collect the compressed version of a vcf file, which can be made with a lossless compression utility tool like gzip. The variant calls in these files might differ from those in a gvcf file because they are made by considering information from all samples. A researcher would want to use these files when considering each project separately.

#### data/endpoints clinical example

### data/ref-data

- External or public datasets not supplied by Research IS or your lab, such as census data.

#### data/ref-data/platform_data omics example

- As cram files are a compressed format, some information is needed as a seperate file. If possible we collect a fasta file for the reference genome used. The fasta file describes offsets for each contig, to compute exactly where to find a particular reference base at specific genomic coordinates. Each fasta file requires an index file as fasta.fai

## manifests/

- Managed by Arcus
- Inventory of all raw & endpoint data
- Inventory of all participants and their related cohorts/samples/family roles, as applicable.
- Associates IDs with all data files.
- Documents relationships between files in pipelines/workflows.

### manifests/file_manifest omics examples

- file_manifest.csv matches biosample IDs to data files and experimental protocols, described in yaml files. Many files might share the same experimental protocol. These yaml protocol files describe experiment and data processing details (described later).

### manifests/file_manifest clinical example

### manifests/participant_manifest omics example

- participant*manifest.csv matches participants/patients to cohorts and biosample IDs. Ideally, biosample_id links to the CHOP biobank. When you cannot link the the biobank, treat biosample_id as the IDs you use for samples taken from participants. If you deal with only one sample type, you might use the participant ID. If you run a treatment/control experiment, you might use {participantID}\_treat and {participantID}\_control as as a biosample ID scheme. If you work with different tissue samples from participants, you might use {participantID}*{tissue} as a biosample ID scheme.

### references/data_dictionary clinical example

- A data dictionary will help people better understand the scope, purpose, and nuance of the data you are collecting.
- Some data dictionaries are extensively detailed, but even a basic minimal data dictionary is better than none at all. Data dictionaries are usually used for tabular datasets, but can be used for data in other formats as well!
- Below are the fields you can consider including in your data dictionary. Only a few are considered truly **required** - the rest are optional but can be extremely helpful, so you should consider whether they make sense to collect in your case.
- You may also have additional fields to include that are not listed here; you know your data best!

**Name​**: (required) provide the name of the data element you are describing as it appears in the dataset.

**Description**​: (required) provide a brief description of the data element. Things to include here if applicable: source of data element, units of measure, formulas for calculated fields, nuances of data capture environment, anything else relevant to understanding what this field means and how to use it.

**Human-readable Name**​: (optional) provide a human readable name / title for the data element. This can be handy if the names in your dataset are hard to parse or hard to understand.

**Type**​: (optional) indicates the type of data i.e. numeric, string, date, etc. If you are collecting data in a database that enforces types, sometimes this can be easily extracted. This is useful to know for future transformation or integration of datasets

**IsNull**​: (optional) this a yes/no field that indicates whether the item can be null (absent of information) or not. If this is set to “no”, this indicates data should ​always​ be present in the field, and is helpful to users who may wonder whether an absence of data is to be expected or indicative of a problem

**Values**​: (optional) if there is a restricted list of values that can populate this field, include that here. An example might be “eye color” with the value list “blue, brown, grey”. Providing the list of values helps users understand why data may be absent. E.g. are there no green-eyed people in the dataset because there were none in the population or because “green” was not one of the available values for this field?

**Date added**​: (optional) indicate the date on which this particular field was added to the dataset. This can be useful for understanding why data may be absent.

**Date removed / Date deprecated**​: (optional) indicate the date on which this particular field ceased to be collected as part of the dataset. This can be useful for understanding why data may be absent.

**Relationships**​: (optional) indicate whether the data element is related to other data elements in your data set (in relational database terms, this is where you would indicate a “foreign key”)

**Additional Documentation**

- In addition to documenting data fields, your data dictionary should also include an overarching description of the dataset itself.
- If you have more than one dataset, or more than one data table, include a description for each. The descriptions for data tables and datasets should include some idea of the scope of data included, as well as the purpose in collecting or creating the data and its intended use.

| adt_occurrence       | The adt_occurrence table contains information about distinct admission, discharge, or transfer events that occur as part of a clinical visit. The typical use case is to identify portions of an inpatient admission that represent different levels of care or locations within a facility, but it can be used for additional characteristics of a visits (e.g. specialty consultation). The time of each event must fall between the start and end times of the associated visit_occurrence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| care_site            | The Care Site domain contains a list of uniquely identified physical or organizational units where healthcare delivery is practiced (offices, wards, hospitals, clinics, etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| concept_ancestor     | The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table is designed to simplify observational analysis by providing the complete hierarchical relationships between Concepts. Only direct parent-child relationships between Concepts are stored in the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table. To determine higher level ancestry connections, all individual direct relationships would have to be navigated at analysis time. The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table includes records for all parent-child relationships, as well as grandparent-grandchild relationships and those of any other level of lineage. Using the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table allows for querying for all descendants of a hierarchical concept. For example, drug ingredients and drug products are all descendants of a drug class ancestor. This table is entirely derived from the CONCEPT, CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP and RELATIONSHIP tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| concept_class        | The CONCEPT_CLASS table is a reference table, which includes a list of the classifications used to differentiate Concepts within a given Vocabulary. This reference table is populated with a single record for each Concept Class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| concept              | The CONCEPTS table contains Standardized Vocabularies that uniquely identify each fundamental unit of meaning used to express clinical information in all domain tables of the CDM. Concepts are derived from vocabularies, which represent clinical information across a domain (e.g. conditions, drugs, procedures) through the use of codes and associated descriptions. Some Concepts are designated Standard Concepts, meaning these Concepts can be used as normative expressions of a clinical entity within the OMOP Common Data Model and within standardized analytics. Each Standard Concept belongs to one domain, which defines the location where the Concept would be expected to occur within data tables of the CDM. Concepts can represent broad categories (like ‘Cardiovascular disease’), detailed clinical elements (‘Myocardial infarction of the anterolateral wall’) or modifying characteristics and attributes that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity of a disease, associated morphology, etc.). Records in the Standardized Vocabularies tables are derived from national or international vocabularies such as SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and LOINC, or custom Concepts defined to cover various aspects of observational data analysis. |
| concept_relationship | The CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table contains records that define direct relationships between any two Concepts and the nature or type of the relationship. Each type of a relationship is defined in the RELATIONSHIP table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| condition_occurrence | The condition occurrence domain captures records of a disease or a medical condition based on diagnoses, signs and/or symptoms observed by a provider or reported by a patient. Conditions are recorded in different sources and levels of standardization. For example: - Medical claims data include ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes that are submitted as part of a claim for health services and procedures. - EHRs may capture a person's conditions in the form of diagnosis codes and symptoms as ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM codes, but may not have a way to capture out-of-system conditions. - EHRs may also capture External Injury codes in different place in the source system. These types of codes are also to be included. Primarily clinical physician based diagnosis as opposed to billing or claim based diangosis data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| death                | The death domain contains the clinical event for how and when a person dies. Living patients should not contain any information in the death table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| device_exposure      | The 'Device' domain captures information about a person's exposure to a foreign physical object or instrument which is used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes through a mechanism beyond chemical action. Devices include implantable objects (e.g. pacemakers, stents, artificial joints), medical equipment and supplies (e.g. bandages, crutches, syringes), other instruments used in medical procedures (e.g. sutures, defibrillators), ventilators and material used in clinical care (e.g. adhesives, body material, dental material, surgical material).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| domain               | The DOMAIN table includes a list of OMOP-defined Domains the Concepts of the Standardized Vocabularies can belong to. A Domain defines the set of allowable Concepts for the standardized fields in the CDM tables. For example, the “Condition” Domain contains Concepts that describe a condition of a patient, and these Concepts can only be stored in the condition_concept_id field of the CONDITION_OCCURRENCE and CONDITION_ERA tables. This reference table is populated with a single record for each Domain and includes a descriptive name for the Domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| drug_exposure        | The drug exposure domain captures any biochemical substance that is introduced in any way to a patient. This can be evidence of prescribed, over the counter, administered (IV, intramuscular, etc), immunizations or dispensed medications. These events could be linked to procedures or encounters where they are administered or associated as a result of the encounter. EHRs may store medications in different vocabularies (GPI,NDC etc). Exclusions: Cancelled Medication Orders Missed Medication administrations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| fact_relationship    | The fact relationship domain contains details of the relationships between facts within one domain or across two domains, and the nature of the relationship. Examples of types of possible fact relationships include: person relationships (mother-child linkage), care site relationships (representing the hierarchical organization structure of facilities within health systems), drug exposures provided due to associated indicated condition, devices used during the course of an associated procedure, and measurements derived from an associated specimen. All relationships are directional, and each relationship is represented twice symmetrically within the fact relationship table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Each person record has associated demographic attributes, which are assumed to be constant for the patient throughout the course of their periods of observation. All other patient-related data domains have a foreign-key reference to the person domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| procedure_occurrence | The procedure occurrence domain contains records of significant activities or processes ordered by and/or carried out by a healthcare provider on the patient to have a diagnostic and/or therapeutic purpose that are not fully captured in another table (e.g. drug_exposure). Procedures records are extracted from structured data in Electronic Health Records that capture source procedure codes using CPT-4, ICD-9-CM (Procedures),ICD-10 (Procedures), HCPCS or OPCS-4 procedures as orders. More specifically the procedure occurrence domain is intended to stores information about activity or processes involving a patient that has a billable code. This includes but is not limited to the following: - LOS Codes ((Eg. 99123) This code may not Not necessarily be a CPT and could require local mapping ) - Lab Procedures (including a Lab Panel Order and Culture Orders) - Surgery Procedures - Imaging Procedures - Ancilliary Therapies (Speech, Physical, Occupational etc)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| provider             | The Provider domain contains a list of uniquely identified health care providers.

### references/protocols omics examples

Below is further description about the metadata elements in a sample fastq protocol:

- **sequencing_type**: Type of sequencing that was performed. You should use the term from the vocabulary list. Common types: WGS, WES, RNA-Seq

- **platform_name**: Platform that was used to perform the sequencing. You should use the term from the vocabulary list. Common platforms: Illumina, Solid, Roche, Ion Torrent

- **instrument_model**: Specific sequencing machine used to produce the sequence file. For a list of illumina platforms, see this link. You should use the term from the vocabulary list.

- **platform_unit**: The platform unit string holds three types of information, the FLOWCELL_BARCODE.LANE.SAMPLE_BARCODE. The FLOWCELL_BARCODE refers to the unique identifier for a particular flow cell. The LANE indicates the lane of the flow cell and the SAMPLE_BARCODE is a sample/library-specific identifier.

- **capture_roi**: File name or file path in the repo for a file that gives specifications and details for the region of interest.

- **capture_kit**: Name of the library preparation kit used with the platform for sequencing the sample. It is important that the name of the kit is standardized and consistent, you should copy the name EXACTLY as it was recorded by the sequencing vendor. Capture kit titles that have been used by previous contributuions are recorded in the the vocabulary list, please use the title listed there when possible.

- **process_description**: Further detail about the library or process used when sequencing the files that is not captured by other metadata terms.

- **read_group_id**: A tag that identifies which read group each read belongs to. A read group is a set of reads generated from a single run of a sequencing instrument, and should be unique for each group.

- **aligned**: Fill in: true or false.

- **genome_build**: If the file is aligned, record the genome build the sequence is aligned to. You should use the term from the vocabulary list. Commonly used genome_build terms: HG19 human reference genome, HG38 human reference genome

- **sequencing_center**: Name of the sequencing center or vendor that did the sequencing of the samples. You should use the term from the vocabulary list. Commonly used sequencing centers: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Division of Genomic Diagnostics (DGD), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) Center, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Center for Applied Genomics (CAG), Broad Institute

- **run_date**: Date the sequence was performed on.

- **targeted_depth**: Total amount of sequence data produced by the instrument (pre-alignment), divided by the reference genome size. It should have been provided by the vendor.

- **stranded**: ONLY RELEVANT FOR RNA-seq DATA. Whether the strand specificity of origin for each transcript was retained. Fill in: true or false.

- **strand_name**: ONLY RELEVANT FOR RNA-seq DATA, and only filled in if above is true. Strand information or kit used. You should use the term from the vocabulary list.

- **creator**: Name and job title of the creator of the protocol.

- **info_provider**: Name and job title for the person that provided the information. May be the same as the creator.

- Content used for producing papers, presentations, websites, metrics, etc.
- Figures & tables: generated metrics and graphics for supporting reports
- Log.md: computational notebook (if one was used to create the content)
- Methods.md: version controlled methods section for the project
- Further subdirectories can be customized.

# requirements/

- Additional requirements files can be added as needed.

# configs/

- Configuration files for workflows or applications.

## configs/environments

### Capturing an Analysis Environment

- For each script/notebook in src, each model in models, and any files in data/endpoints, there should be an env._ file (here env._ refers to a file named env with any extension, so env.yaml or env.txt, for example) that describes the environment in which it was created or run.
- Environment files should be named as follows: descriptiveName_env.\* and placed in a folder called environments within the configs/ directory.
- Either individuals files or entire folders(whichever is the appropriate level) in scripts and notebooks within the src/ directory, the models/ directory, or the data/endpoints folder will need to be added to the env_manifest.csv file, matching them with their related environment file.

### Arcus Lab Images

- There should also be a file named lab-image-tag within a folder titled lab-image within the configs/ directory that contains the tag of the Arcus Lab Image that the Lab was using.
- Though unlikely, if artifacts use more that one image than follow the directions above (in the environments section): add a descriptive name to each lab-image-tag file, and add the file paths and related files or directories to the env_manifest linking them together.
