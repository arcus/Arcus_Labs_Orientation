@overview

## Data Type

Please select what type(s) of data you have:

- [ ] clinical data
- [ ] omics data
<script output="data_type">"@input"</script>


<script modify="false">
try {
  let data_type = @input(`data_type`)

  if(data_type[0]) {
    send.liascript(`**Working with clinical data** 

Here is some information specific to clinical data. 
And here is an image: 

![FAIR data principles graphic](media/FAIR_data_principles.png)<!-- style = "max-width: 600px" -->
`)
  } else send.clear()
} catch(e) { }
</script>

<script modify="false">
try {
  let data_type = @input(`data_type`)

  if(data_type[1]) {
    send.liascript(`### Working with omics data 

Here is some information specific to omics data. Note that it doesn't start a new page even though there is a header in here. It includes a list:

- files
- computing
- results!
`)
  } else send.clear()
} catch(e) { }
</script>


<script modify="false">
try {
  let data_type = @input(`data_type`)

  if(!data_type[0] & !data_type[1]) {
    send.liascript(`**Nothing is selected** 
<br>
Pick the data type you want to learn about above! You can select more than one if you like.
`)
  } else send.clear()
} catch(e) { }
</script>

This is a general paragraph that will show up regardless of what is selected above. 
More contingent text follows, but it's done with a macro this time instead of copying out the whole script each time.

@contingent_text(0,`More clinical info, including a comma.`)

@contingent_text(1,`This content is about omics.`)
