# New to Bash?

![](media/terminal.png)

Do you need to how to use the "shell" (or bash, the command line, or the terminal) and don't know where to start? This guide will provide a very brief overview of what these are, and will give you some resources where you can find more information. 

**What is the Shell?**

The "shell" is an program that allows you to interface with your computer by passing commands directly to the operating system. One of the most common shell programs is called a **bash** shell (this is what is used in the Arcus Labs). Usually, users interact with the bash shell using a **command-line interface**, or CLI. In the Arcus Labs, this interface is called the **Terminal**.

**Why use bash in the Terminal?**

Interacting with your computer using bash and a CLI like the Terminal has several benefits:

* Preparing files for processing, and actually processing them, can be time-consuming and error-prone to do one file at a time. 
* By writing bash **scripts** and running them in the Terminal, you can repeatedly perform a series of commands on a file (or multiple files). 
* Bash scripts can make use of other programming languages (like R or Python), other applications, and APIs. 
* Using scripts (which can be saved and run over and over again on new data) helps your analyses reproducible! 

## Arcus-Specific Training



## Additional Resources

The training videos barely scratch the surface of how to get started.  We did that on purpose, so that they're short enough that everyone can watch them.

But they aren't enough to get you started **really** learning Bash/Terminal.  You have several options when it comes to growing in your skills.

If you prefer something a bit more "just in time", however, we suggest some resources that the Arcus Education team has crafted as part of [an NIH grant aimed at educating biomedical researchers](https://www.research.chop.edu/announcements/dbhi-and-drexel-collaborate-to-advance-biomedical-data-science-education).

This grant includes the creation of dozens of modules that are aimed at being 1 hour or less in duration and each have a narrow focus and clear learning objectives.  They are asynchronous and you can take them at any time!

<div class = "warning">
If you think you'd like to participate in a research study about the educational effectiveness of data science training modules, please reach out to Arcus Education's DART program via:

* Our interest form at https://redcap.link/dart-interest
* Taking the screening for participation in the study at https://redcap.link/DART-survey
* Emailing us at dart@chop.edu

and consider **not** consuming these modules.

Consuming these modules will **render you ineligible to participate** in our research.  However, we know that they're useful on their own, outside of our conduct of research, so we're fast-tracking access to these materials.
